# ZeroToSql
Scripts for database creation of the Zero to SQL in 20 lessons book
This project is a set of database scripts used to help other learn the SQL language.  I didn't want to use the adventureworks database as I thought this a bit too complex to begin with and I wanted to create something a few people could relate too--animals.

The database is purposefully de-normalized for example purposes.  I realize this might cause issues if you want to add additional pet types to the database.  The purpose of posting this project on GitHub is to invite collaboration among those who might want to create addtional data for these sources.

The scripts include a database creation script, which was build in SQL 2014, so there may be some version issues. There is an object creation script to create the tables and functions used and another to insert the data.  

There is an 'optional' script for inserting some additional data; however, none of the scripts from the book use these tables.
